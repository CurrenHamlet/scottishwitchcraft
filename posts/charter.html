<p class="indent">Our goal for this project is to analyze, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the effect of time on the diversity of accusations and the outcome of witch trials in early modern Scotland by focusing on four of the major witch hunts, using data from the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft database. This project is not intending to correct widespread misconceptions about witch hunts in Europe or Scotland. Several historians have already used the database for that purpose (for these sources, see <i>Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland</i>). Instead, we will focus the majority of our time comparing and contrasting data from four periods of time when witch accusations spiked in early modern Scotland: 1597-1598, 1628-1631, 1649, and 1661-1662. Focusing on these dates will limit the scope of data we need to look at, and allow us to thoroughly investigate each hunt as an individual phenomenon. This will allow for a focused qualitative analysis of a select few exemplary cases from each hunt, so we can better contextualize the quantitative analysis that we will carry out in our data visualizations. </p>
<p class="indent">At this point, we have four research questions, with the plan to address each one with a different form of data visualization. Our questions are as follows: </p>

<ul> <!-- yes, this is an unordered list with numbered items, but the formatting was mysteriously fucked up when i tried using an ordered list -->
    <li>1. How did the geographic concentration of accusations change throughout the major hunts of Scotland? </li>
    <li>2. How does the ratio of acquittals to total witch accusations change during the major hunts in Scotland? </li>
    <li>3. How do four major witchcraft hunts differ in the connections of other named witches in cases? </li>
    <li>4. How does the appearance of the Devil change throughout the four major great witch hunts in Scotland? </li>
</ul>

<p class="indent">We will analyze Question 1 with map visualizations that display the concentration of accusations in areas of Scotland during each of the four hunts. To achieve this, we need to decide what type of geographic data to use. The Survey has five different columns that concern geographic information for each case: Parish, County, Settlement, Burgh, and Presbytery. Some cases do not have data for every column, and the available data varies in specificity. We also need to choose which mapping tool we will use to create these maps, as simply dropping pins on Google maps would be an inefficient and misleading representation of our data. We haven’t finalized how the base map will look, but we’ve discussed creating and digitizing a historical-looking map that incorporates elements from 16th or 17th century designs. Question one is the question we have the most methodological issue with because there are so many different options open to us. </p>
<p class="indent">We will analyze Question 2 with a bar graph that shows the number of accusations compared with acquittals. Other than cleaning our data, this is probably the easiest of our questions to address. A bar graph, while simple, will adequately display the information in our data set. To create the graph, we will use either Microsoft Excel or R. </p>
<p class="indent">We will analyze Question 3 with a network analysis map, using each accused or named witch as a node. We plan to use Palladio for this analysis, but we still need to learn the basics of this tool and how to clean our data so that the tool is usable. </p>
<p class="indent">We will analyze Question 4 with a textual analysis, using text from trials where the Devil’s appearance is described. The textual analysis tool that we will use is Voyant. We still need to learn how to use this tool; however, it looks like we will have to do a minimal amount of cleaning our data to plug it into the tool. </p>
<p class="indent">We will present our analysis and data visualizations on a project website. The website’s final design depends on the outcome of our research questions and the results of the individual visualizations. Our team is currently still deciding on how we want to style the overall website but are inspired to make it modern and minimal to have it be approachable to a wide audience. Yet also are interested in taking elements from art and looks of the time period we are studying, for example woodblock prints and a monochromatic color scheme. We hope to present meaningful findings by looking at the dataset from a multitude of different viewpoints, so the final website will be accessible to a wide audience. Our site will include a narrative introduction to the project, presenting our research and findings, as well as an annotated bibliography. Along with the narrative, we will display at least five data visualisations and two maps to support our conclusions. We will also create a timeline that provides context for the specifics of our topic and research questions. Illustrations and photographs may be implemented as well to lend guidance to the writing. </p>
<p class="indent">Our website will include an “About” page that provides technical descriptions of the project's sources, processing, and presentation. This page will give us an opportunity to explain the reasoning behind our decisions throughout our work on the project. We will introduce the technical tutorials we created for class, and recognize each team member’s specific roles in the project. Finally, we will use this page to acknowledge specific people who helped us along the way, including Professor Julian Goodare, our expert interviewee. </p>
<p class="indent">The final section of the site will be a critique of the data, revised from the critique we already published on our Github blog. </p>
