    Davenport Adams Book II of <i>Witch Warlock, and Magician</i> offers historical contextualization to both witchcraft of England and Scotland through its historically recorded inception, to its demise. This version was released in 2012. Adams' intention with the work may be regarded as a “contribution towards that “History of Human Error,” another piece of literature by Mr. Caxton. Primarily collecting stories to help narrate a timeline of malignant history.

    Much of the second book is focused around witchcraft history specific to England, while using only a portion of the writing for Scotland. He also uses the last part of the book to talk about witchcraft oriented literature. The significance of this work for our project’s use is mainly concealed within the witchcraft categorized in Scotland. It enriches our data with more detailed stories about particular points in the data set. We are given a personal connection to the data through these stories, and will help us research our data set further. Included in this section references reasoning behind Scottish witchcraft including environment, weather, and political involvement. These will be useful avenues to venture to help our team further develop our research.
