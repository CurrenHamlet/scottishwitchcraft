<p class="indent">
    Davenport Adams Book II of <i>Witch Warlock, and Magician</i> offers historical contextualization to both witchcraft of England and Scotland through its historically recorded inception, to its demise. This version was released in 2012. Adams' intention with the work may be regarded as a “contribution towards that “History of Human Error,” another piece of literature by Mr. Caxton. Primarily collecting stories to help narrate a timeline of malignant history.

<p class="indent">
    Much of the second book is focused around witchcraft history specific to England, while using only a portion of the writing for Scotland. He also uses the last part of the book to talk about witchcraft oriented literature. The significance of this work for our project’s use is mainly concealed within the witchcraft categorized in Scotland. It enriches our data with more detailed stories about particular points in the data set. We are given a personal connection to the data through these stories, and will help us research our data set further. Included in this section references reasoning behind Scottish witchcraft including environment, weather, and political involvement. These will be useful avenues to venture to help our team further develop our research.

    Cowan, Edward J., and Lizanne Henderson. <i>History of Everyday Life in Medieval Scotland.</i> Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011.

<p class="indent">
    This source gives an overview and some specifics about how people lived in Medieval Scotland, during the time that witch hunts were occurring. The book was published in 2011 by Edinburgh University Press and Edited by Edward J. Cowan and Lizanne Henderson. Included are some general facts about people of the time as well as some specific areas of life.
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Many of the specific sections and much of the general information is not directly relevant to the witch hunts. There are however a couple chapters that discuss the witch hunts. In chapter 1, the book explains that while the King has a great interest in everyday people's lives, most people lived not how the King intended but as how their land owners desired. This is relevant to considering how witch hunts were conducted. In chapter 5, it is explained that in many rural locations, doctors were expensive so many people would turn to local healers. These healers were then in several cases tried as witches. Chapter 10 goes into the most depth about witchcraft, talking about some of the periods that witch hunts were conducted and who was affected and was affected by these witch hunts.

    Dye, Sierra. “To Converse with the Devil? Speech, Sexuality, and Witchcraft in Early Modern Scotland.”<i>
      International Review of Scottish Studies</i> 37 (2012): 9
  </p>
<p class="indent">
    This article explores specifically speech and sexuality associated with witchcraft in early modern Scotland, to further understand how and why witch hunts were so prevalent during this time. Written by Sierra Dye, a second year PHD student in Scottish Studies at the University of Guelph. This is issue 37, and it was published in 2012.
</p>
<p class="indent">
    The author uses a viewpoint of witchcraft as a speech crime, to help explain possibilities in why accused witches were more often women, but also reasoning behind the accusations of both males and females. Dye uses these findings as a way to represent how local and state authorities managed to monopolize powerful speech. This is a great source for our research to help us build a more focused group path to present the data in the most compelling, understanding, and meaningful way in our power.

<p class="indent">
    This source is the introductory essay by senior scholar Julian Goodare in a 2013 collection of Scottish Witch hunt essays. Goodale's purpose of this article in his own word is “to comment on the ways in which the Survey [of Scottish Witchcraft] can best be used.” Goodare states how his Survey has both a large number of cases, and some cases have a great deal of information while some are very sparse.

    This source's value is that it gives valuable insights to the Survey by its project head. Demonstrating how he views the flaws of the Survey and how to use other primary sources to overcome these flaws. A limitation of this source is that it makes avid reference to the other articles in the collection that we cannot access, leaving us with a confused notion of what Goodare is referencing.

  </p>
<p class="indent">
    This book is a collection of essays on Scottish history in the 1500s by various writers, in honor of Michael Lynch, a prominent Scottish historian. The essays cover a diverse range of topics including religious conflict and ritual, political conflict with England, and the influence of the Scottish monarchy. The essays are arranged roughly chronologically, as well as according to the essays’ related themes.
</p>
<p class="indent">
    The value of this source is that it provides some historical context for the era before and during the events of our dataset. There are no mentions of witches explicitly. In the second chapter, however, Andrea Thomas writes about King James IV and the influence of Christianity (specifically the pope) on his coronation ceremony and his reign in general. The pope encouraged him to take an oath to eradicate heresy and abolish all false religions (which might include witchcraft), but it’s unclear whether he actually took or followed this oath (48). We can use the historical details within the essays to guide and refine our research questions.

    Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Charles.<i> A Historical Account of the Belief in Witchcraft in Scotland. </i> Wakefield:
    SR Publishes, 1972.
  </p>
<p class="indent">
    This source was written by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esq., of Hoddam Castle. Much of this book is specific stories and tales of witches but provides some good insight into beliefs around witches. In chapter 1 there is a story that tells of how a witch escaped a castle by impossibly avoiding soldiers and arrow barrages. The story also accounts running from a witch and using a river to escape, because at the time the belief was that witches could not cross a body of water.
</p>
<p class="indent">
    In chapter 2, the execution of Lady Janet Douglas and her family is highlighted. The reason for her execution was the murder of James by poison or witchcraft. This event showed that even nobles were at risk of witch hunts. Later, in chapter 4, it is explained that James IV wrote a “Demonology.” This text looked at the secrets of witches and tried to explain why witchcraft was more common with women, essentially very misogynistic. A Historical Account of the Belief in Witchcraft in Scotland turned out to be not as directly relevant to our database but provided good context and beliefs that are useful to understanding the beliefs of the time.

  </p>
<p class="indent">
    This source is an article published in the journal of Human Nature by Niek Koning. The author examines previous scholars’ theories on the development of witchcraft beliefs across cultures, and proposes their own explanation based on patterns in the relationship between social development and modes of subsistence. Koning also presents several data tables to support their claims.
</p>
<p class="indent">
    This article is useful as a potential explanation for why rates of witch accusations increased during various periods of Scottish history. According to Koning, fear of witchcraft fluctuates with a society’s mode of subsistence (hunter-gatherer, forager settlement, pastoral, hand-tool farming, plow agriculture). Witchcraft beliefs are uncommon among foraging societies, and more common among pastoral or more advanced farming societies. Hierarchy and individualism (modes of social solidarity) push cultures away from the paranoia of witchcraft.

    Levack, Brain P. <i> The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe</i> London and New York: Longman, 1987.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    This source is a book by an American historian of early modern Europe, Brian P Levack. The book was published in 1987. It was created after Levack noticed a need for a “one-volume study of the entire European witch-hunt.” It contains information on witch-hunts between 1450 to 1750 in Europe and the American colonies. The book focuses on creating a more complex and nuanced understanding of the causes and decline of the witch-hunts.
  </p>
<p class="indent">
    A value of this work is that its scope is before that of our data set, contextualizing some information that the data set does not contain. Another value of this book is that it outlines many scholarly debates surrounding the witch-hunts, which we can investigate further with our data set. A limitation of this source is its pan-European focus, limiting the amount of information it has specifically on the Scottish witch-hunt.

  <p class="indent">
    <i>The Privy Council and the Witches: The Curtailment of Witchcraft Prosecutions in Scotland, 1597-1628</i> was written by Michael Wasser and published by The Scottish Historical Review in 2003. This article talks about the Privy Council which was essentially a council that handled witch trials at a higher level than just local ‘towns’. The intro contains several good context dates, outlines some more intensive witch hunts, and gives some background to these hunts.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Some important points include a lull in witch hunting during 1597-1628 that is correlated somewhat with decreases in witch hunts in France, Spain, and England. There was also a fair amount of opposition to the witch hunts which meant that when some significant figures died, their death affected the amount of trials that were happening.

    This opinion piece by Whitney Wimbish talks directly about our data set. This piece is not incredibly relevant to contextualizing Medieval Scotland, but provides some good context on the significance of this database. Some of these points include bringing light to the Scottish witch hunts and allowing us to remember this history. This piece argues that if we forget about the witch hunts or any other piece of terrible history, we are more likely to repeat it.

<p class="indent">
    This source is an article from the journal of Religions by Laurel Zwissler, a professor of philosophy and religion at Central Michigan University. Zwissler criticizes the foundational scholarship in the study of religion, especially that of Tylor, Frazer, Durkheim, and Freud, whose Euro-centric and Christian-centric views historically diminished the role of women, people of color, and non-heteronormative groups in their theories on the origins of religion.
</p>
<p class="indent">
    This article is useful in providing some historical context for witches being tried in both religious and secular courts. Initially, Christianity did not associate peasants’ folk beliefs with satanic practice; these beliefs were just untrue. Later, as Christian elites sought to eradicate all competing beliefs, they aligned themselves with peasant communities’ fear of witchcraft.

  <p class="indent">
    In the piece Henderson: <i>Witchcraft and Folk Belief in the Age of Enlightenment. Scotland, 1670-1740,</i> it is explained that the field of witchcraft still has continuing potential. This is a relatively short but informative piece about themes surrounding witchcraft at this time. One such theme is that while enlightenment thinkers were skeptical of witchcraft and magic, there was still a very real concern about witches. According to this piece, Henderson believes that witch beliefs survived well beyond the end of the witch-hunts. The final point this piece makes suggests that “witchcraft theory” was used to manipulate, prove, or disprove political and religious points of view. Essentially saying that witchcraft, or at least the idea of witchcraft, was used to the benefit of politicians and religious figures.
