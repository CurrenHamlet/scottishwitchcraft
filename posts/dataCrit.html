    The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft is a database containing information about all known individuals accused of
    witchcraft in early modern Scotland. The database was published in 2003 by Julian Goodare, Lauren Martin,
    Joyce Miller, and Lousie Yeoman. They intended to “collect collate and record all known information about
    accused witches and witchcraft belief in a Microsoft Access database and to create a web-based user interface
    for the database.” The data was collected by first looking at existing surveys of Scottish witchcraft then by
    archival research over two years by the two full-time researchers, Joyce Miller and Lauren Martin. Charlotte
    Moon also created a website and database tools for the project. The project director was Dr. Julian Goodare, a
    professor of Scottish history at the University of Edinburgh. The co-director was Dr. Louise Yeoman, a former
    curator at the National Library of Scotland and researcher with BBC Scotland.

    The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft used three previous surveys to jump-start the research for their own
    database. They used George Black’s 1938 Calendar of Cases of Witchcraft in Scotland: 1510-1727. The SSW used
    this non-comprehensive survey because it lists close to 1,000 specific trials, and because it includes lists
    of cases and local published sources. The team did acknowledge that the source was limited because Black did
    not work with any manuscripts that could have contained more information. The next survey, Source-Book of
    Scottish Witchcraft, was researched and written by Christia Larner, Christopher Hyde Lee, and Hugh McLachlan,
    and published in 1977. This survey used manuscripts and had information on 3,000 cases. This survey would be
    revised by Stuart Macdonald in the 1990s. From this work, McLachlan created the Scottish Witch Hunt Data Base,
    and from this database the SSW added 1,000 more cases and expanded the information about each case.

    From here, the SSW was expanded from the use of various sources such as Private Papers belonging to the
    Maxwell of Pollok family, the Burgh Court Books, and Burgh Treasurer’s Accounts, assumed information to
    specific cases. Miscellaneous manuscript sources were also referenced, such as the Aberdeen City Archives, a
    box containing items relating to the witchcraft trials from Aberdeen between 1595 and 1597, mostly including
    paperwork records, as well as printed records of the parliamentary meetings and decisions of Parliament of
    Scotland. The Miscellany of the Spalding Club Volumes I, IV and V, held edited transcripts of documents from
    witchcraft trials. These were held in Aberdeen in the 16th century and provided specific case information. The
    data gathered includes any type of information on trials, lore, investigations, manuals; anything related to
    witchcraft in Scotland. Examples of this can be seen in all of the sources used to compile this data. Orkney
    Folklore and Traditions informed the research team of folklore traditions in the Orkney Islands, which also
    included accusations and specific prosecutions. Witchcraft trials were recorded in edited transcripts from
    Spottiswoode Miscellany: a collection of original papers and tracts, illustrative chiefly of the civil and
    ecclesiastical history of Scotland, volume 2. They acquired an edited transcript of the Campbells and
    hereditary jurisdiction from The Justiciary Records of Argyll and the Isles, volume 1. However, much like many
    of the references, it is not a complete record of the proceedings, and the source of compilation is unknown,
    meaning it was possibly taken from one or more records. The reason for belief is due to no official
    authenticated signatures, but the information from the chosen records was still recorded and categorized to be
    included in this data set.

    The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft built a web version of the database, designed to help the public and
    academic researchers to explore the organized files in a digital setting. The database formatted in this way
    has allowed for structural patterns to be actualized. Providing a digital format for this data was a way to
    provide an examination on biographical and social information about the accused witches—such as age, sex,
    marital status, or economic class—and even draw information on what the town was like for the accused.
    Information like this also falls under a cultural category, like belief systems and legal proceedings of the
    trials. The interactive maps give insight into national and regional variations, and the chronological and
    geographical placements of both the accused and prosecutors.

    The raw data itself is quite extensive, including name, surname, maiden name, sex, settlement, country, etc.
    One of the shortcomings, however, is in the apparent lack of data for some entries. Almost every entry
    includes name, surname, sex, and country, but many are missing data for age, marital status, socioeconomic
    status, occupation, and other notes. This lack of consistent data may present some biases or limits when
    analyzing these data points.
