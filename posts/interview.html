<p class="indent">We interviewed Julian Goodare, a professor of history at the University of Edinburgh and the director of the team that created the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database. Goodare’s perspective provided helpful insight on the database’s origins and its relevance for scholars today. We primarily discussed our research questions and asked a series of prepared questions about Professor Goodare’s own experience. </p>
<p class="indent">Prepared questions: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Our main research theme is comparing the major witch hunts of Scotland. Currently the five major hunts we are thinking about are: 1590-1591, 1567, 1628, 1631, and 1661-1662. Another scholarly source said that the major witch hunts where 1590-1, 1597, 1628-30, 1649, and 1661-2. Looking at the timeline of in Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database, the spikes of accused witches don't line up with either of these dates perfectly. We are wondering what you consider to be the major hunts, or if you have any insights on how to pick which hunts to focus on.</li>
    <li>What were some flaws with earlier datasets that you overcame, or attempted to overcome, with the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft?</li>
    <li>What preconceptions (e.g. about witches, magic, early modern Scotland) did you have before directing the database’s creation that may have shaped the project’s outcome?</li>
    <li>Are there any ways that you haven’t seen the database used yet, that you think would be interesting?</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent">The first question was simply clarification, but since we plan to organize our project around the dates of major witch hunts, it was also the most directly helpful answer. Professor Goodare largely confirmed the dates we already had, identifying the major periods of witch “panic” as 1590-1591, 1567, 1628-1631, 1649-1650, and 1661-1662. At his recommendation, we looked back to the Survey data to double check these points. Going forward, our project will focus on four periods of panic: 1597-1598, 1628-1631, 1649, and 1661-1662.</p>

<p class="indent">In regards to the Survey’s relation to previous witchcraft datasets, Goodare explained that this survey was a new project, not an update to an existing dataset. The Sourcebook of Scottish Witchcraft from the 1970s was the most relevant collection of data on the Scottish witch hunts. The Survey used data from previous projects as a jumping-off point, but also included new data, such as local records from kirk sessions and presbyteries, that earlier datasets left out. </p>

<p class="indent">When asked about what preconceptions he and his team members may have brought to the Survey’s creation, Goodare admitted that he wasn’t sure in his answer, and that someone outside his team would be more able to identify the Survey’s biases. That being said, some preconceptions may have been centered around the team members’ academic research interests. These included, why the witch hunts happened and why people were burned at the stake, as well as the Scottish church’s involvement, and witch hunts at the village level. Additionally, interest in looking at popular religious practices of the time and healing methods may have influenced the database. Although the team tried to include a range of data categories that could be useful to other scholars, their own research interests are likely represented the most. For example, Goodare said that in retrospect, they should have included a category about witches’ flight. </p>

<p class="indent">Goodare had a number of ideas regarding how the Survey could be used in new ways, several of which are likely too far out of our scope to cover in this project. He expressed interest in the professionalism of court proceedings at witch trials, as well as the uncommon visionary experiences that some accused witches confess to under torture. One interest that was quite relevant, however, was looking to create more visualisations of links between cases and trials, when one witch accuses another. This idea is something we can work towards with our network analysis visualization. </p>

<p class="indent">Overall our talk with Goodare was very useful. He confirmed the relevance of our research questions and helped to clarify the scope of our investigation. He also pointed out a few secondary sources which will be helpful for further contextualizing our research going forward. </p>
