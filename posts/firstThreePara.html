    The major object of study of this site is the physical appearance of the Devil in early modern Scotland. By analyzing the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft from the University of Edinburgh, we explored numerous paths to display and analyze the data provided. Eventually, we settled on observing patterns in how accused witches described what the Devil looks like. Using both the survey and witch hunting texts, we were able to see how accused witches reported seeing the Devil, contrasted with how the witch hunting texts of the time describe the Devil. Furthermore, through the survey, we are able to see how the number of reports and descriptions of the devil change throughout the four major witch hunts. These witch hunts, during 1597-1598, 1628-1631, 1649, and 1661-1662, were times of heightened witchcraft accusations and trials. This project seeks to display these patterns using primary sources as well as using secondary sources to contextualize explain why these different patterns occurred.

    Many scholars of early modern Scotish history have made a point to try to correct misconceptions about the witch hunts and create a more nuanced understanding of the Scottish witch hunts. Currently the leading narrative is that the fear of witches is a phenomenon that was spread by the higher classes of Scotland. A consequence of this understanding of the Scottish witch hunts is that it causes researchers to focus a lot on the witch hunters, as vectors of spreading the fear of witchcraft. Senior scholars like Julian Goodare, the project manager for the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, see the future of Scottish witch hunt studies in examining hunters and the victims. By doing this scholars can look at the individuals that initiated the hunts and inturn see why some hunts, like the four major ones which we will be focusing on, had much more victims.

    During our interview with Dr. Julian Goodare, the project director for the Survey, we discussed new avenues not yet fully explored by scholars of early modern Scotland. One major research route that has yet to be explored very deeply was questions based on the varied appearances of the Devil in early modern Scotland. The similarities of these descriptions show the witch hunter’s hand, and we believe that the varied nature of the appearances can aid in answering questions about the culture of early modern Scotland. How did the representation of the Devil change throughout Scotland’s witch hunts? Was there geographical difference variation on a preferred representation of the devil? Our goal is that these research questions are used as a jumping off point to join distinct data from a particular time period to a larger understanding and more significant sum of knowledge for others to enjoy and use.
